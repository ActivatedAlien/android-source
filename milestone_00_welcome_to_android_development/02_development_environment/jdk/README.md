## Your First Java Class

To get this show on the road, open your command prompt and CD into this directory (jdk).

Run the following command:
`javac -d bin -sourcepath src src/com/bloc/firstpackage/MyFirstJavaClass.java`

If you see an error, check to make sure you've typed in the command exactly and try again.

After it returns successfully, CD into the bin directory:
`cd bin/`

From within bin, run the following command:
`java com.bloc.firstpackage.MyFirstJavaClass`

You should see the following outputted to your prompt:
`Welcome to Bloc's Android apprenticeship! You're on your way!`

Congratulations, you've ran some pretty gnarly code! Ready for more? Of course you are.
