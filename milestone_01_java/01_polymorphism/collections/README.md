## Collections

Open your command prompt and `cd` into this README's directory (collections). Edit MyArryaList.java and implement the methods which have been indicated. NOT ALL methods are required to be implemented for this checkpoint, don't do extra work unless you're into that kind of thing.

After you've finished, compile your code by running the following command:

``` bash
$ javac -d bin src/com/bloc/collections/*.java 
```

After it compiles successfully, `cd` into the bin directory:

``` bash
$ cd bin/
```

From within bin, execute your code by running the following command:

``` bash
$ java com.bloc.collectios.Main
```

If you see a nice congrats message, you've successfully implemented your own version of List!

Commit and push your changes often.
