## Polymorphism

Open your command prompt and **CD** into this README's directory (polymorphism). 

After you've finished, compile your code by running the following command:

``` bash
javac -d bin src/com/bloc/statics/*.java src/com/bloc/statics/appliances/*.java
```

After it compiles successfully, **CD** into the bin directory:

``` bash
cd bin/
```

From within bin, execute your code by running the following command:

``` bash
java com.bloc.statics.Main
```

If you see a nice congrats message, everything's been properly static-o-fied!

Commit and push your changes often.
