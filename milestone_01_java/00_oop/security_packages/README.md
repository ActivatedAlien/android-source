## Security And Packages

Open your command prompt and **CD** into this README's directory (security_packages). The sample code **DOES NOT COMPILE**. Fix the security and package organization of this project. You will need to move or modify all files, including `Main.java`.

After you've finished, compile your code by running the following command:

``` bash
javac -d bin src/com/bloc/{your_package_1}/* src/com/bloc/{your_package_2}/* â€¦ src/com/bloc/securitypackages/Main.java
```

After it compiles successfully, **CD** into the bin directory:

``` bash
cd bin/
```

From within bin, execute your code by running the following command:

``` bash
java com.bloc.securitypackages.Main
```

If you see a nice congrats message, everything's been properly organized!
