## My First Android Application

Your assignment is to start a new Android application: **BlocNotes**. BlocNotes will be the Android ship which sails you across the sea of knowledgeâ€¦ Looking back at that sentence, I regret it but I'd feel disingenuous taking it back.

During the next few milestones, you will be learning paramount Android features and APIs as you incorporate them into BlocNotes, a simple note-storing application. By the end of it, your copy of BlocNotes will be an incredibly well-rounded Android application with features expected of a high quality product.

* **Launch Android Studio** Start Android Studio and wait for it to load. If you have a previous project open, close it. The helper window should be visible now
